# Presidential Polling App
Develop some more familiarity with web scraping using Beautiful Soup to create a summary of the race and polls of the US election.

It contains some general information that can be used to infer the standings and progression of the current US Presidential election.

The focus was to explore Beautiful Soup for more web scraping and more Flask familiarity (although it was very light in this project).
